              Bev Standing felt violated when she discovered how her voice was
              being used
            </h3>
            <p>
              It converts writing into speech, which can then be played over
              videos uploaded to the app, often for comedic effect. Bev Standing
              recorded about 10,000 sentences of audio for the state-backed
              Chinese Institute of Acoustics research body to use in
              translations, in 2018. The legal action claims her voice can now
              be heard in viral videos featuring “foul and offensive language”,
              causing her reputation “irreparable harm”.
            </p>

            <p>
              Standing, from Ontario, Canada, told BBC News no permission had
              been given for these recordings to be used in any other
              applications or resold. “My voice is my product - it's my
              business," she said. "You can’t just use it and not reimburse me
              for what I do. “If you want to use someone's voice, pay for it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Standing, who does not use TikTok, felt "violated", after several
              videos were sent to her by friends, family and colleagues. “When I
              realised you could get me to say anything you want... that's when
              I kind of got upset,” she said, describing the content as “totally
              against brand.” “I'm certainly hoping it doesn't affect my
              business in a negative way. "Clients may stop hiring me because
              they recognise that voice."

            </div>

            <p>
              Robert Sciglimpaglia, the lawyer representing Ms Standing, told
              BBC News: “The technology exists where anyone's voice can be
              replicated through artificial intelligence. “This is not an issue
              just about celebrities or voice actors, who of course will be
              hugely impacted because their livelihood is literally being taken
              away from them. “This is also about ordinary people." Neither
              TikTok nor parent company Bytedance had responded to the legal
              filing, issued in New York last week, he added.
            </p>

            <p>
              Standing’s voice is used on the North American version of the app.
              But in other regions, local accents - a British male voice in the
              UK, for example - are used. A TikTok representative told The
              Telegraph, which first reported the story, it did not comment on
              continuing litigation. The company told BBC News it had nothing
              further to add. The Chinese Institute of Acoustics did not respond
              to a request for comment.
